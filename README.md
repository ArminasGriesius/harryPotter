## About the project

Welcome to my "Harry Potter Quiz" project! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This project offers a fun and challenging quiz for Harry Potter fans, testing your knowledge of the magical world created by J.K. Rowling. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the quiz presents a series of questions with multiple-choice answers, allowing you to dive deep into the lore of Hogwarts and its inhabitants.

**Objective**:

With this project, my aim is to provide an entertaining experience for Harry Potter enthusiasts while also showcasing my skills in frontend development. By combining interactive elements, I hope to engage users and create an immersive quiz environment. It's not just about answering questions correctly; it's about celebrating the magic of Harry Potter and sharing that excitement with fellow fans.

So, whether you're a seasoned wizarding world expert or just dipping your toes into the world of Hogwarts, join me on this enchanting journey through the Harry Potter Quiz!
